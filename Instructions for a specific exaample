Program

Given the contribution of tourism to Cyprus’s economy, the hospitality industry assumes a significant role as an enabler of socio-economic growth by generating tourism Euros and employment opportunites.  Developing and operating hotel assets is capital intensive and hence it is imperative that the returns on investment are credible enough to ensure long-term viability, particularly when faced with growing competition from sharing economy platforms like Airbnb and Homeaway.  In addition to hotel rooms, a hitherto untapped opportunity exists in the food and beverage (F&amp;B) operations to drive up profitability, particularly for independent small scale hotel developers and operators.  Data compiled by <a href="http://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/statistics-explained/index.php/File:Number_of_persons_employed,_by_economic_activity,_2013.png">EUROSTAT</a> suggests over 20% of the workforce in Cyprus’s service sector works in the F&amp;B industry.

The growth drivers of the service sector of an economy are increasingly beholden to data-driven decision making, the convergence of which forms the basis of business intelligence (BI).  While other verticals of the service sector are increasingly adopting a data-driven approach to decision making, the F&amp;B industry is yet to leverage the potential of business intelligence.  To fully realize the economic and socio-cultural benefits, it is contingent upon the F&amp;B industry to complement the art of gastronomy with a scientific approach to decision making by leveraging the convergence space of digital platforms and data analytics. Given its fragmented nature and scale of operations, capacity building using training and exposure to best practises attains particular significance in order to sustain growth in revenue and cost optimization through customer acquisition, retention and satisfaction. In practical terms, this need translates into enabling the restaurateurs, café owners, outlet managers and employees to use cost-effective digital platforms and tools for data analysis in making informed decisions in finance and operations (e.g. menu engineering, staffing) and  marketing (e.g. social media engagement, customer satisfaction and retention).

In addition to F&amp;B outlets embedded within hotels, this vertical also includes stand-alone, independent cafes, restaurants which together make a significant contribution to  Cyprus’s service-driven economy by providing substantial entrepreneurial as well as employment opportunities.

Audinece

This seminar targets the management team of F&amp;B of hotel outlets, restaurants, and cafes as well as the private sector owners/F&amp;B managers of small and micro-enterprises in the hospitality food and beverage industry. Furthermore, this expert seminar will offer valuable insight to the hospitality industry stakeholders who deal with revenue and marketing operations.

Participants will benefit from the seminar as they will understand how to effectively scope, source and analyze data for achieving competitive advantage, profitability and sustainability.

Objectives

This expert seminar will enable participants to collate, organise and analyse data (proprietary and external/third party) leading to informed decision-making under conditions of business risk and uncertainty for enhanced competitiveness and profitability. Ability to handle data visualisation and modelling using user-friendly, cost-effective digital computing tools will result in innovative strategies and optimised restaurant or outlet operations.

The seminar content is informed by current trends and research in data analytics and its applications in the F&amp;B industry.  The key themes include, though are not restricted to defining and computing industry-specific metrics and KPIs with a focus on menu engineering techniques for driving cost and revenue optimisation, guest satisfaction, engagement and loyalty using digital platforms including social media channels and demand estimates.

Product and service differentiation will be contingent on the ability to analyse and overlay micro-level proprietary data such as customer profile and satisfaction, costs and revenue with macro-level data available on the Internet which include reliable third-party sources (e.g. Google Trends, Insights, Eurostat), social media reviews and other user-generated content. Thus, the key takeaways of the seminar can be summarized into the following objectives:
<ul>
 	<li>Familiarize with overall data-driven business intelligence landscape in the F&amp;B sector</li>
 	<li>Develop analytical skill sets using legacy and open source cloud-based platforms for actionable insights on costs, revenue, and customer satisfaction</li>
 	<li>Define KPIs and metrics for menu engineering</li>
 	<li>Design monitoring mechanisms using quality control charts for gauging impact of menu engineering</li>
</ul>
During the seminar, there will be demonstrations on how to use data visualisation and predictive analytics using micro and macro level data.  Case studies and industry best practices will be discussed to demonstrate the power of data science. These will include themes related to:

REVENUE MANAGEMENT

CUSTOMER ACQUISTION AND ENGAGEMENT

QUALITY ASSURANCE

Conclusively, this authoritative and comprehensive seminar delivers tools and skill sets that enable participants to appreciate the emerging trends in F&amp;B analytics towards optimising revenue, guest satisfaction, and loyalty, thereby adding value to the destination’s economic and socio-cultural landscape.

<strong>Case Study 1 Co-Evolution of IT &amp; Processes: The Differentiator in Services</strong>
Abstract: There is a need for processes and Information Technology to co-evolve. Earlier, there used to be heavy application of IT in manufacturing and other enterprise functions, a spurt in the form of Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP), Software Configuration Management (SCM), etc. In the current economic development, phase services sector is leading the way for economies to grow. Services are altogether a different landscape and there is a need for IT and services to co-evolve. This will lead to a more efficient and productive system, which would be analytic, intelligent and have the capability to formulate new service processes if the need arises. This is also going to be the new frontier that will act as a differentiator in the service industry landscape.

<strong>Case Study 2 Customer Satisfaction in the restaurant industry: An examination of the transaction-specific model</strong>
Abstract: Abstract Purpose – To determine the factors that explain customer satisfaction in the full service restaurant industry. Design/methodology/approach – Secondary research and qualitative interviews were used to build the model of customer satisfaction. A structured questionnaire was employed to gather data and test the model. Sampling involved a random selection of addresses from the telephone book and was supplemented by respondents selected on the basis of judgment sampling. Factor analysis and multiple regression were used to test the model. Findings – The regression model suggested that customer satisfaction was influenced most by responsiveness of the frontline employees, followed by price and food quality (in that order). Physical design and appearance of the restaurant did not have a significant effect. Research limitations/implications – To explain customer satisfaction better, it may be important to look at additional factors or seek better measures of the constructs. For example, the measures of food quality may not have captured the complexity and variety of this construct. It may also be important to address the issue of why customers visit restaurants. Instead of the meal, business transactions or enjoying the cherished company of others may be more important. Under the circumstances, customer satisfaction factors may be different. The results are also not generalizable as the sampled area may have different requirements from restaurants. Practical implications – Full service restaurants should focus on three elements – service quality (responsiveness), price, and food quality (reliability) – if customer satisfaction is to be treated as a strategic variable.

<strong>Case Study 3 Social Media Use in the Restaurant Industry: A Work in Progress</strong>
Abstract: Abstract A survey of 166 restaurant managers reveals a mixed picture in their use of social media and its impact on operations. Although many restaurants are using social media, the study found that many restaurateurs lack well-defined social media goals, both in terms of the purpose of the restaurants’ social media activities and the target of their social media messages. Although the restaurant operators in this convenience sample were generally supportive of the use of social media, well over half were not certain that social media met one or more of three specific goals, namely, increasing customer loyalty, bringing in new customers, and boosting revenues. The respondents generally rely more heavily on non-financial metrics than on actual financial numbers to measure the return on their social media investment, due to the large degree of uncertainty surrounding how to measure the financial returns of social media on operations. On balance, independent restaurants made more use of social media than did chains. The study’s findings suggest that restaurateurs should reevaluate their social media approaches to ensure that they are strategically designed and executed.

<strong><em>Case Study 4  </em></strong><strong><em>Time-and capacity-based measurement of restaurant revenue</em></strong>

Abstract:  In this article, the authors examine how a common metric of revenue performance—RevPASH, or revenue per available seat-hour—is calculated. In a simple example, a real restaurant, and an extensive simulation study, the authors find inaccuracies in the existing approaches to calculating RevPASH. However, the extent of the inaccuracy is much greater when RevPASH is calculated based on check open times rather than on the time interval from check open to check close. Since accurate RevPASH values are important in guiding managers’ revenue-enhancing decisions, the article’s findings have importance for practice. Furthermore, as RevPASH has been a commonly used metric for academic research, the article’s findings are important for those performing research on restaurant revenue management.

<strong>Case Study 5  Food and Beverage Cost Control Process of Hotel Enterprises</strong>
Abstract:  Income provided from food and beverage (F&amp;B) sales is an important source of revenue for the hospitality industry. Therefore, hotel enterprises which are one of the most important elements of accommodation industry should perform an F&amp;B cost control in order to minimize costs and increase customer satisfaction. For an effective cost control process; F&amp;B cost control processes and cost control points need to be monitored carefully. The purpose of this study is to investigate F&amp;B cost control processes of hotel enterprises in Orlando, FL and perform an importance-performance analysis for the issues appear to be critical in F&amp;B cost control processes. Regarding the literature review, it is expected that there is a significant difference between the size of the hotels and their F&amp;B cost control processes. To this end, in order to collect data, the research establishes a questionnaire survey to be performed by F&amp;B managers of Orlando hotels to find out the existence of those possible differences. Also, the research investigates the usage rate of Activity-Based Costing (ABC) in hotel enterprises as an overhead allocation method. The research will deploy quantitative data analysis for the evaluation of survey results.

<strong><em>Case Study 4  </em></strong><strong><em>Time-and capacity-based measurement of restaurant revenue</em></strong>

Abstract:  In this article, the authors examine how a common metric of revenue performance—RevPASH, or revenue per available seat-hour—is calculated. In a simple example, a real restaurant, and an extensive simulation study, the authors find inaccuracies in the existing approaches to calculating RevPASH. However, the extent of the inaccuracy is much greater when RevPASH is calculated based on check open times rather than on the time interval from check open to check close. Since accurate RevPASH values are important in guiding managers’ revenue-enhancing decisions, the article’s findings have importance for practice. Furthermore, as RevPASH has been a commonly used metric for academic research, the article’s findings are important for those performing research on restaurant revenue management.

<strong>Case Study 5  Food and Beverage Cost Control Process of Hotel Enterprises</strong>
Abstract:  Income provided from food and beverage (F&amp;B) sales is an important source of revenue for the hospitality industry. Therefore, hotel enterprises which are one of the most important elements of accommodation industry should perform an F&amp;B cost control in order to minimize costs and increase customer satisfaction. For an effective cost control process; F&amp;B cost control processes and cost control points need to be monitored carefully. The purpose of this study is to investigate F&amp;B cost control processes of hotel enterprises in Orlando, FL and perform an importance-performance analysis for the issues appear to be critical in F&amp;B cost control processes. Regarding the literature review, it is expected that there is a significant difference between the size of the hotels and their F&amp;B cost control processes. To this end, in order to collect data, the research establishes a questionnaire survey to be performed by F&amp;B managers of Orlando hotels to find out the existence of those possible differences. Also, the research investigates the usage rate of Activity-Based Costing (ABC) in hotel enterprises as an overhead allocation method. The research will deploy quantitative data analysis for the evaluation of survey results.
